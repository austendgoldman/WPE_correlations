Objective: Determine which measurements are having the biggest effect on the chip's overall performance.

Overview:
1. For each chip, pull in the tracking and results data that contain calculations for every (X,Y) coordinate on the chip. 
4. Map these files to the desired chip prototype. 
5. Conclude which calculations from the data are most correlated with the main measure of chip's overall performance ('WPE').
